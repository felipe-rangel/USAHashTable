# USAHashTable
C++ USA Cities Databse organizes a text file containing over 25,000 lines of all named places in the United States into a hash table. The places are hashed by their state abbreviation and place name concatenated together. The hash function yielding the hash value can be seen as the first method in the class HashTable.
Once the program reads the input file (provided) and then prompts the user if it wants to search for a specific place or for all places with the same name. Then the program takes in the string input into the hash function to find the place if it exists in the data set.
